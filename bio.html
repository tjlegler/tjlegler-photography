    <h2>Artist Biography</h2>

    <p>
        TJ is a multidisciplinary photographer whose work merges light, movement, and environment 
        into visionary visual experiences. Beginning his creative journey in Mississippi, TJ was 
        featured in the PBS broadcast <em>Mississippi Roads</em> in the segment 
        <strong>“Sparks of Creation”</strong>, where his lightpainting process using steel wool 
        and long-exposure techniques was showcased at the Mississippi Museum of Art.
    </p>

    <p>
        After relocating to Colorado, he reemerged post-pandemic with a series of art shows 
        across the state and was selected for the <strong>Rural Art Show Rural/Urban Exchange</strong>, 
        where his work highlighted the relationship between humans, landscape, and motion.
    </p>

    <p>
        TJ’s photography evolved into immersive lightpainting and cinematic portraiture, eventually 
        giving rise to <strong>The Neon Lounge</strong> — a collaborative, evolving art installation 
        integrating live projection, mixed digital textures, and long-exposure portrait creation. 
        As a resident artist, he became a staple across Front Range venues including 
        <em>Cervantes</em>, <em>The Black Box</em>, <em>Junkyard Social Club</em>, 
        <em>Vali Soul</em>, and multiple Colorado music and arts festivals.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to his creative installations, TJ’s fine art practice includes high-end metal prints, 
        gallery-quality framed work, and expansive landscape photography across the American West. 
        His involvement with <strong>Matador Network</strong> led to a featured tourism photography 
        package, further expanding his creative reach.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, TJ continues to explore the boundaries of light, time, and perception — producing deeply 
        atmospheric imagery that blends mystical storytelling with technical precision. His nomadic 
        approach to artmaking fuels an ever-growing body of work grounded in freedom, exploration, 
        and experiential creativity.
